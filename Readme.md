Key Steps to Build a Neural Network from Scratch
1. Define the Architecture:
Decide the number of layers, how many neurons each layer has, and what activation functions you will use.

2. Initialize Weights and Biases:
Randomly initialize weights (and biases, if used) for each layer. The dimensions of these matrices should match the network architecture.

3. Forward Propagation:

--> Compute the linear combination:

            z=W⋅x+b
            
--> Apply an activation function (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU) to introduce non-linearity:

            a=σ(z)

4. Compute the Loss:
Use a loss function (e.g., mean squared error for regression or cross-entropy for classification) to measure how far off the network’s predictions are from the target values.

5. Backpropagation:
Calculate the gradients of the loss with respect to each weight and bias. This involves applying the chain rule to backpropagate the error from the output layer to the input layer.

6. Update Weights and Biases:
Use gradient descent (or a variant) to update the weights and biases:

                W=W−η⋅ ∂W/∂L
​
where η is the learning rate.

7. Iterate:
Repeat forward propagation and backpropagation for many iterations (epochs) until the network’s performance improves.


Explanation
Data:
In this example, we’re using a simple dataset that mimics the XOR problem. This is a common toy problem for testing neural networks.

Network Architecture:
The network has an input layer with 2 neurons, one hidden layer with 3 neurons, and an output layer with 1 neuron.

Activation:
The sigmoid function is used for both the hidden and output layers.

Training Loop:

Forward Propagation: Calculates the activations for the hidden and output layers.
Loss Calculation: Uses mean squared error to determine how well the network is performing.
Backpropagation: Computes the gradients needed to update the weights and biases.
Weight Update: Adjusts the parameters in the direction that minimizes the loss.
This code provides a simple yet comprehensive illustration of how a neural network operates from scratch. It can be extended to more complex networks and additional features like different activation functions, more layers, or regularization techniques as you explore further.
